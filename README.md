# Real-Time-Speech-Recognition
A real-time speech recognition system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) implemented in Python. This project captures audio input, processes it to extract features, and transcribes spoken words into text. It utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the RNN model and the speech_recognition library for real-time audio capture and processing.
